This game challenges the user to click on the crystals in order to match the random number. Each crystal has a different value that is randomly generated. The only way for the user to see the values of the crystals is by clicking them. When the user clicks a crystal, its value is added to the user's total score. 


The user wins by matching her total score to the randomly generated number shown to the right. If the user exceeds the random number, then she loses. The different values of the crystals as well as the random number all change after each win or loss. 


The difficulty with this assignment stemmed from working with all of the gem buttons efficiently. After some time and guidance I learned a bit more about the use of attributes and functions to make the code more clear, succinct, and efficient.
